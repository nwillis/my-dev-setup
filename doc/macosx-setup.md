# My MacOSX Development Environment Setup
*I'm currently working in VR(Immersed), so my needs are highly related to that environment*


## Requirement Software for a Fresh Installed System
Minimalistic software installation.

- Google Chrome (to sync with my Chromebook)
- Immersed Desktop Agent (for connecting with my OC2)
- Amethyst Window Management (for keep multiple windows tidy)
- Stats (for system status monitoring)

## Terminal.app Setup
*I agree the designing philosophy of ChromeOS, software is just a service, I don't want to install many packages locally. So iTerm2 is excluded.*

- xcode-select --install
- Homebrew
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)")
```
- SFMono with NERD patch (https://github.com/epk/SF-Mono-Nerd-Font)
- Dracula theme for Terminal.app (https://draculatheme.com/terminal)
